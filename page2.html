          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
     
     <h2>what is oops in c++ ?<br><br></h2>
     <p>Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming.
     Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
      hiding,,
     polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the 
     data and the
     functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that
     function.<br><br>
     <mark>"C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications".
     C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br></mark><br>
     <mark>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
     The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.<br><br></mark></p>
     <h2>basics of c++ :-<br><br></h2>
     <p>c++ is an object Object-Oriented programming languages,<mark>c++ was developed by jarney stroustrup at AT & BeLL lab,  USA in esrileighties. 
     c++ was developed from c and simula 67 languages in c++ was early called 'c with classes'.<br><br></mark></p>
     

     <h2>Characteristics of procedure oriented programming :-<br></h2>
       <p>1. Emphasis is on doing things(algorithm)<br>
        2. Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.<br>
        3. Most of the functions share global data.<br>
        4. Data move openly around the system from function to function.<br>
        5. Function transforms data from one form to another.<br> 
        6. Employs top-down approach in program design.<br><br> </p>

        <h2>Features of the Object Oriented programming :-<br></h2>
        <p>1. Emphasis is on doing rather than procedure.<br>
2. programs are divided into what are known as objects.<br>
3. Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.<br>
4. Functions that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the data 
structure.<br>
5. Data is hidden and canâ€™t be accessed by external functions. <br>
6. Objects may communicate with each other through functions.<br>
7. New data and functions can be easily added. <br>
8. Follows bottom-up approach in program design.<br><br></p>
         
<h2>APPLICATION OF OOP :-<br><br></h2>
<mark><p>The most popular application of oops up to now, has been in the area of user interface 
design such as windows. There are hundreds of windowing systems developed using oop 
techniques.<br></p></mark>

<h3><mark>Real business systems are often much more complex and contain many more objects 
with complicated attributes and methods. Oop is useful in this type of applications because it 
can simplify a complex problem. The promising areas for application of oop includes.<br></h3></mark>
<h2>1. Real - Time systems :-<br></h2>
<p>Real-time system inherits complexities and makes it difficult to 
build them. OOP techniques make it easier to handle those complexities.<br></p>
<h2>2. Simulation and modeling :-<br></h2><p>It is difficult to model complex systems due to varying 
specifications of variables. Stimulating complex systems require modeling and understanding 
interaction explicitly. OOP provides an appropriate approach for simplifying these complex 
models<br></p>
<h2>3. Object oriented databases :- <br></h2>
<p>The databases try to maintain a direct correspondence between the 
real world and database object in order to let the object retain it identity and integrity.<br></p>

<h2>4. Hypertext,hypermedia and expertext :-<br></h2>
 <p>Hypertext is similar to regular text as it can be stored, searched, 
and edited easily. <mark>Hypermedia on the other hand is a superset of hypertext. OOP also helps in 
laying the framework for hypertext and hypermedia.<br></p></mark>
<h2>5. Al and expert systems :- <br></h2>
<p>These are computer application that is developed to solve complex 
problems which are far beyond the human brain. OOP helps to develop such an AI expert 
System.<br></p>
<h2>6. Neural networks and parallel programming :- <br></h2>
 <p>It addresses the problem of prediction and 
approximation of complex-time varying systems. OOP simplifies the entire process by 
simplifying the approximation and prediction ability of the network.<br></p>
<h2>7. Dicision support and office automation systems :-<br></h2>
  <p>These include formal as well as informal electronic systems that 
primarily concerned with information sharing and communication to and from people inside and 
outside the organization. OOP also help in making office automation principle.</p><br><br>
 <h2>syntax :-<br></h2><br>
      <h3>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
        using namespace std;<br>
        
        int main() {<br>
         <mark> cout << "Hello World!";<br></mark>
          return 0;<br>
        }<br><br></h3><br>

        <h2>Example:-<br></h2><br>
        <h3>#include<iostream.h> <br>
            using namespace std;<br>
            void fun(){<br>
             static int i=0; //static variable<br>
             int j=0; //local variable |<br>
             i++; <br>
             j++; <br>
             cout<<"i="" << i and j="<< j<< end1;<br>
            }<br>
            int main()<br>
            {<br>
                fun();<br>
                fun();<br>
                fun();<br>
            }<br><br>
           <mark> output:-<br>
            i=  1 and j= 1<br>
            i=  2 and j= 1<br>
            i=  3 and j=1<br><br></mark></h3>

        <h2>c++ in comments :-<br></h2>
       <p> Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable.
         <mark>It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
         Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.<br><br></mark></p>
             <h2>1-single-line comments single-line-<br></h2>
           <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).<br>
            Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler 
            (will not be executed).<br><br></p>
           <h2>example:-<br></h2>
           <p><mark> // This is a comment<br>
                cout << "Hello World!";<br><br></mark></p>
             <h2>2-multi-line comments-<br></h2>
           <p> Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.<br>

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:<br><br></p>
<h2>example-<br></h2>
<p>/* The code below will print the words Hello World!<br>
to the screen, and it is amazing */<br>
<mark>cout << "Hello World!";<br></mark></p>
